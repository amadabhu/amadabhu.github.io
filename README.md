### About Me

I come from a civil and environmental engineering background and slowly transitioned to software engineering. I'm interested in using data to accomplish socially beneficial outcomes. I'm really passionate about climate change, cybersecurity and how we shift our focus as a society to tackle our largest problems. I like working with a mixture of hardware and software problems and am always tinkering!
